<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3>OSA Metallurgical Technician at Glencore, October 2023 - Current</h3>
<p>
I held the key responsibility of maintaining the OSA’s (on stream analysers) and troubleshooting any issues 
that arose. In this role I had the opportunity to be involved in transformative projects that altered the way the 
ore was processed and refined to achieve better yield such as the rejects recycling plant trial.
Another aspect of this role was completing test work on a variety of products to determine their suitability as a 
potential additive to the plant feed. I would also conduct test work to simulate specific processes in the plant 
under different conditions to identify opportunities for greater optimisation. This test work involved designing 
functional apparatus’ and devising methods to mimic key processes on a smaller scale and using laboratory 
techniques to obtain analytical results from which I would form comprehensive reports, which would guide 
engineers in how they run the plant. This role afforded me the opportunity to explore various areas of the 
plant and deepen my understanding of the processes as well as work with a variety of people including senior 
engineers and technical specialists in the ore leach and the refinery areas.  
</p>

<h3>Clinician at Perth Brain Centre - April 2024 - September 2024</h3>
<p>
    As a clinician at the Perth Brain Centre I performed QEEG brain scans which assess patient brain function and 
allow the development of personalised drug free therapy to help a range of conditions such as ADHD, anxiety, 
depression, autism, memory problems as well as to enhance brain performance. Another aspect of this role 
was providing this therapy to patients, typically in the form of neurofeedback therapy. This involved careful 
electrode placement on the skull, setting up the right protocol for that individual, and monitoring their 
progression, as well as communicating with the patient to understand their needs, receive feedback and assist 
them in getting the most out of their treatment.
</p>

<h3>OSA Day Laboratory Technician at Glencore, September 2022 - September 2023</h3>
<p>
    This role included a variety of responsibilities. Principally, sample analysis and laboratory upkeep which 
included the making up and standardisation of solutions used in sample analysis, performing routine 
maintenance on instruments, conducting a range of checks to ensure safety and proper functionality of 
equipment.  
Additionally, I was required to fill in for crew members, the product quality analyst, and OSA technician 
anytime people were on leave, which has made me familiar with a range of laboratory instruments and 
techniques. From this experience I have gained highly effective prioritisation and time management skills, as I 
had to focus on the needs of the company and prioritise the most critical work in a highly time efficient 
manner whilst also making sure I am still maintaining safe work practices. I also often held the additional 
responsibility of being the Chief Muster Warden on site. 
</p>

<h3>Metallurgical Technician at Glencore, November 2021 - August 2022</h3>
<p>
Conducting metallurgical test work as part of ore characterisation and plant optimisation studies. This role 
required me to take an active approach and use my initiative and problem solving abilities to investigate and 
learn from the results of the ongoing testwork I conducted. I took it upon myself to work on fine-tuning the 
new CEC method by testing different variables to determine the influences on the final CEC value, leading to 
improved efficacy of the method.
</p>    

<h3>Laboratory Technician - Vaction Student at Glencore, December 2020 - February 2021</h3>
<p>
    Employed during vacation period as a laboratory technician, which involved working in a team to analyse 
samples from the plant. My specific role included operating the centrifuge, titrotherm, performing titrations 
and using pH, ORP and conductivity probes.
</p>

<h3>Tutor at Kumon Morley Education Centre, February 2020 - November 2020</h3>
<p>
    Employed on a casual basis tutoring maths and English to primary and high school students. Working here 
helped me develop effective communication skills.
